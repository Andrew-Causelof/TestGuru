The main goal

Psychological, educational or professionals testing is a broad term used to
identify measures that help assess people across a variety of domains such as
oneâ€™s emotional or intellectual functioning.
Tests are most commonly administered and interpreted by a psychologist who has
earned a doctoral degree. Typically the use of tests is comprised of a battery
of several different tests which is determined by the psychologist and varies
depending on the problem or questions to be answered.
